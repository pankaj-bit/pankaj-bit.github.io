# Sorting_Visualizer
This project will help you to Visualize the Sorting algorithms properly. I have used different color for comparing element So its quiet understandable. Also I have put the Ascending and Descending button to give input in Ascending or Descending order. Also put the number of comparisons and basic time complexity info after running the particular algorithm which will help you to compare time complexity.
